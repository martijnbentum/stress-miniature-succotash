Trained stress classifiers based on different inputs:

1. duration
2. intensity
3. pitch
4. formant
5. spectral-tilt
6. combined-features
7. codevector
8. cnn
9. Transformer layer 5
10. Transformer layer 11
11. Transformer layer 17
12. Transformer layer 23

And trained and tested the classifiers on the following language materials:

1. dutch
2. english
3. german
4. polish
5. hungarian

Collected MCC performance metric and applied LDA on resulting matrix
