The structure of the codebook over pretraining visualized with a voronoi plot based on cosine similarity distance matrix 

The polygons are colored according to the counts for the specific codevector based on phoneme /t/


Checkpoint training Step 100, many codevectors are used and codevectors polygons evenly distributed

Checkpoint training Step 1000, some codevectors are not used

Checkpoint training Step 5000, most codevectors are not used

Checkpoint training Step 10000, some codevectors are used some of the time mor adjecent codevector usage, maybe different sized polygons

Checkpoint training Step 50000, range of frequency of use and many adjacent, middle polygons are smaller and mostly unused

Checkpoint training Step 100000, range of frequency of use and many adjacent ( but less smooth than at 50K) middle polygons are even smaller
