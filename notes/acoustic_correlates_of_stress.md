## Overview of the acoustic correlates of stress for Dutch, German and English

Intensity, duration, formant peripherality, pitch, spectral tilt (used LDA to compute a single value) and all acoustic features combined.

Stressed syllables are typically louder (higher intensity), have a longer duration, the formants F1 & F2 are more peripheral, have a shallower spectral tilt. The distributions of stressed and unstressed vowel shown below for Dutch, German and English show tendencies in the expected directions.
